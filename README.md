# Pycaret-AnalysisPycaret-Analysis-of-all-Classification-models

With PyCaret, we spend less time coding and more time on analysis of our Dataset.
We can do analysis of any Dataset, Regression or Classification with 3 lines of Code.

In this project, I used the library to gain Insights on Peptides Dataset (Peptides are important molecules with diverse biological functions and biomedical uses).
Did Normalization with different methods, Feature Selection, Outlier Removals, PCA and Analysed and created output files of Analysis
